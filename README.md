# MBTA - Trains Schedule

![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title")

Imagine you live in the Boston area and want a quick reference for when the next train will be coming at a particular stop. Using the MBTA API (details below), write an app using the latest version of Angular to display what time the next train will arrive at your stop.
### Requirements:
• Use a service to fetch the data from the API.
• Inject the service into the component to display the next arrival time.
• When the arrival time is less than 10 minutes from the current time, change the color of
the time display to something that will get your attention (yellow, red, orange?) Also, an
• “Arriving soon” message should appear somewhere on the screen.
